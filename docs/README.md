[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/curtgrimes/vmix-rest-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/curtgrimes/vmix-rest-api)

## Steps to finish

1. Enable [Travis](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/#To-get-started-with-Travis-CI%3A) for your repository (**note**: you already have `.travis.yml` file)
2. [Create GitHub access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/); check `public_repo` on `Select scopes` section.
3. Use the token value as a value for [Travis environment variable](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Defining-Variables-in-Repository-Settings) with the name `GH_TOKEN`
4. Make a test commit to trigger CI: `git commit --allow-empty -m "Test Travis CI" && git push`
5. Wait until Travis build is finished. You can check progress by clicking on the `Build Status` badge at the top
6. If you did everything correct, https://curtgrimes.github.io/vmix-rest-api/ will lead to your new docs
7. **[Optional]** You can setup [custom domain](https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/) (just create `web/CNAME` file)
8. Start writing/editing your OpenAPI spec: check out [usage](#usage) section below
9. **[Optional]** If you document public API consider adding it into [APIs.guru](https://APIs.guru) directory using [this form](https://apis.guru/add-api/).
10. Delete this section :smile:
